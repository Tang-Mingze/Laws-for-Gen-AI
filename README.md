This project focuses on dataset construction based on two key AI regulations:

1. **China — Interim Measures for the Management of Generative Artificial Intelligence Services**
   Each provision in **（生成式人工智能服务管理暂行办法.txt）** is paired with a relevant **neutral prompt** and corresponding **positive and negative output examples**, all stored in **（Chinese_dataset.json）**.

3. **European Union — AI Act**
   All articles have been extracted and stored in **（Euro_AI_Act folder）**.
   The **articles selected** for dataset construction are listed in **（Selected_articles_id.json）**, and these selected articles have been **split into individual provisions**, stored in **（Selected_articles_split.json）**.
